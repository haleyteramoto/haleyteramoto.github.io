I feel like I’ve written about a lot of firsts since starting these and my ICS 314 class. All of my previous classes were Java or C code and were mainly focused on developing our fundamentals. So assignments weren’t really about creating anything really, it was using this technique to get this result. Which I guess is what you could say about any assignment from school really, but in ICS 314 we’ve recently been tasked with learning about UI Frameworks. 

Now, in terms of coding, I wouldn’t say it's as hard as other assignments we’ve done. The first week we just used raw HTML and CSS but then now we’ve been practicing with Bootstrap 5 and it has simplified the whole thing down. We get the base for the code already from Bootstrap 5, we get the icons, and it just becomes trying to create a site that is aesthetically pleasing. So now we don’t have to do everything from scratch like in the first week, and if you look at the websites I’ve made from the first to second they look so much better. There is an argument to say that websites made using Bootstrap 5 can come across as similar in the fact that the layout is pre-designed and can limit creativity. The same idea can be said for all UI Frameworks, but the convenience makes it hard to say no to.
