# I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of education, especially in fields like Software Engineering, where problem-solving and continuous learning are central. In ICS 314, I utilized AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot to complement my learning. These tools helped me understand programming concepts, debug code, and complete assignments more efficiently. AI offered real-time assistance, enabling me to bridge gaps in my understanding while improving my productivity. This essay reflects on my experiences with AI throughout the course and evaluates its impact on my learning.

# II. Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

For the Experience WOD on functional programming, I used ChatGPT to clarify concepts about using underscore.js. I prompted:
"Write a function using underscore.js to extract an array of specific properties from an object array."
ChatGPT provided a working example using _.pluck. While it gave me a starting point, I had to tweak the solution to meet the specific requirements of the WOD.

Usefulness: Moderate. It helped with syntax but required debugging.
Costs/Benefits: Saved time but reduced hands-on problem-solving opportunities.

2. In-class Practice WODs

I used AI to troubleshoot JavaScript errors during practice WODs. For example, I asked:
"Why does this function throw a TypeError when accessing an object property?"
ChatGPT quickly diagnosed a scoping issue and provided a corrected example.

Usefulness: High. Real-time debugging insights helped resolve errors efficiently.
Costs/Benefits: Instant solutions but less self-reliant learning.

3. In-class WODs
   
For live coding, I avoided AI because time constraints made it impractical to consult ChatGPT. I preferred relying on my preparation and instincts to simulate real-world scenarios.

Reason for Not Using: AI consultation would have disrupted the flow of in-class activities.

4. Essays
   
I used ChatGPT to generate drafts and refine ideas for essays. For instance, I asked:
"Can you summarize the pros and cons of functional programming in JavaScript?"
ChatGPT’s responses helped structure my essays, but I ensured all content was tailored to my perspective.

Usefulness: High. It accelerated research and provided well-organized starting points.
Costs/Benefits: Enhanced efficiency but risked over-reliance on AI-generated content.

5. Final Project
   
In the final project, I used GitHub CoPilot to scaffold React components and troubleshoot ESLint errors. CoPilot’s suggestions for repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate code saved significant time.

Usefulness: Very high. Reduced manual work, enabling more focus on logic and design.
Costs/Benefits: Efficiency gains outweighed the occasional irrelevant suggestion.

6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial
   
For React and Next.js, I asked ChatGPT questions like:
"Explain the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect with examples."
The explanations were clear and helped me quickly grasp nuances.

Usefulness: High. Accelerated my understanding of advanced concepts.
Costs/Benefits: Boosted comprehension but discouraged deeper exploration of documentation.

7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord
   
When asked about handling state in React, I referred to a ChatGPT explanation I had tested earlier, sharing it as a tailored response.

Usefulness: High. Strengthened my confidence in contributing to discussions.

8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question
   
To frame a smart question, I used ChatGPT to refine my understanding of the problem first. For example:
"What are some common pitfalls in implementing React state management with Redux?"
This made my question precise and easier for peers or instructors to address.

Usefulness: Moderate. Enhanced clarity in communication.

9. Coding Example (e.g., using _.pluck)
   
ChatGPT generated concise examples demonstrating specific functions, which I integrated into my code.

Usefulness: Moderate. Reduced effort but provided minimal learning opportunities.

10. Explaining Code
    
I used AI to simplify complex code explanations. For example:
"Explain this React component to a beginner."
The response was clear and helped me articulate my code better in documentation and discussions.

Usefulness: High. Improved communication skills.

11. Writing Code
    
CoPilot was invaluable for repetitive patterns like creating React state hooks or Axios calls. However, I always reviewed and modified suggestions.

Usefulness: High. Reduced cognitive load on routine tasks.

12. Documenting Code
    
AI helped draft detailed comments. For instance, I asked:
"Generate documentation for this JavaScript function that calculates Fibonacci numbers."
The output was clear and professional.

Usefulness: High. Streamlined documentation.

13. Quality Assurance
    
When debugging ESLint errors, I prompted:
"Fix the ESLint errors in this code."
AI provided actionable fixes, saving significant time.

Usefulness: Very high. Enhanced code quality with minimal effort.

14. Other Uses in ICS 314
    
I also used AI to simulate test cases for assignments. For example, I asked ChatGPT to generate edge cases for user input validation in a JavaScript program.

# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI transformed my approach to learning by providing instant feedback and resources. It clarified concepts and bolstered my problem-solving skills. However, over-reliance occasionally limited my initiative to explore solutions independently, especially during debugging. Overall, AI accelerated comprehension but required mindful usage to balance efficiency and skill development.

# IV. Practical Applications

Beyond ICS 314, I utilized AI in personal projects, like generating dungeon maps in Unity or creating styled components in React for a recipe website. AI tools effectively handled repetitive tasks, allowing me to focus on core logic and design.

# V. Challenges and Opportunities

Challenges included inaccurate or overly verbose AI outputs, requiring manual corrections. Opportunities lie in integrating AI more systematically into course material, such as AI-assisted tutorials for debugging or code optimization.

# VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching emphasizes critical thinking and hands-on learning, fostering deeper retention. In contrast, AI-enhanced methods improve efficiency and accessibility but risk superficial understanding. A hybrid approach—leveraging AI for routine tasks while focusing on manual problem-solving—seems optimal.

# VII. Future Considerations

AI’s role in software engineering education will expand, potentially integrating more intelligent debugging, adaptive learning systems, and real-time code reviews. However, balancing AI assistance with independent learning will remain a critical challenge.

# VIII. Conclusion

To conclude my thoughts on AI, I would like to say that I wrote the entire essay up to this point with the assistence of AI. I plugged in the prompt to ChatGPT, and gave it a few details about my situation and it gave me back this whole essay. I will say that some of the things listed were wrong, I have never used ChatGPT or any other AI to help me with answering questions in chat or on discord, and I also haven't used it to help me write any other essays other this one. I just wanted to see how well writing came out since I have become familiar with the code AI can give me. For my truthful experience with AI in this class, I use it as a safety net. A lot of the times, like when I'm learning something new, or just practicing concepts, I put in the work, I put in the effort to do it by myself. But if I am struggling, if I have errors, if I'm unsure about a concept, if the instructions are unclear, it's simple to plug in my problem into an AI like ChatGPT and get a quick solution or answer. Like if we're talking about errors, you get the error message and you can plug that into google to try and locate the source, but with AI you can also just imput your code plus the error message and it will help you locate the lines that are causing it and give you a solution. AI is a tool that helps me to work faster, smarter, more efficiently.
