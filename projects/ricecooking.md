Rice Cooker Recipes is a project created to combat the second greatest problem college students face, being trying to eat a well balanced meal. The problem: students don't have the time, money, or resources to create meals that will leave them full, healthy, and satisfied. The solution: a website that allows students to find and share recipes that are cheap and require limited kitchen facilities.

# My Contributions

My focus was split between the front and back end of the website. I helped to create the aesthetic of the website, giving it a simple, intuitive, layout that makes it easy for the user. Coding wise I helped to create the landing and home page on the front end, and on the back end I worked on creating a search function that offers the user multiple ways they can look for recipes, as well as helping to create and seed the recipe component itself. I also helped my team members with integrating their code from their branch into main, resolving any conflicts, and either fixing any errors myself or allocating it to someone who could do it.

# What I Learned

This project taught me what it meant to be a part of a team. For the most part, up until this, my coding projects have been individual assignments. Being a part of this team made me become more aware of how I documented my code, made me write more thorough comments, descriptions, and issues, and also made me better understand how to allocate tasks for a more efficient production. Communication was a big thing as we had to be on the same page in terms of what we wanted, and while I do feel like I could improve from what we learned, I am proud of what we accomplished.
